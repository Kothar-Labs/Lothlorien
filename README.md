# The Farlands

Hand-on psychological support and breakdown-control when clinical therapies are out of reach. Currently implements motion-sensing/pan-videogame modules, through the conception of *meta-universe*, to simulate the effect of mental treatments under the framework of *process consultation*. Note that **This cannot entirely replace the necessity of pharmaceutical or electromegnetical interventions. Obey the instructions of the professional if available.**

## Notice
- Many people are suffering from mental distortions/illnesses as well as I. I couldn't turn a blind eye to this mess, but the contribution of mine alone is far from enough. Don't be mad at me for not updating this proj. or doing random stuff. I'm only the pixie here to help.
- If you want to view the documentation of requirement of this proj. go to `Projects`.
- I do want a little bit of humor and warmth here and there in this repository. I'm also open for others to share their emotions and moods: they're not bugs, they're features! Feel free to pull-request every now and then if one needs help. In short, I want it to be Christmas here every day!
- There is only one condition for contributors to be qualified: Being happy everyday, if you feel like that's what you want to do.
- Whatever we want to do, we do, that's what a project is, you know. It's not only a repo and a frame and a board and the code, that's what a proj. *need*, but what a proj. *is*, is what `The Farlands` really is: it's **freedom**.

## Do We Really Have to Do This?

A huge project indeed. I struggled a lot before starting it, since as I comprehend it would be something like proving the Riemann Hypothesis, but the final answer is positive.

According to an experience of my own, I gave it my all in negotiating with parents and related personnel to get the opportunity to receive some medical treatment once. At a great cost, of course. As the breakdown issue went on, I cannot afford the cost of such endless bargain and parlay, so a second opportunity may not present itself to me.

I didn't stand down, yet I could do nothing besides some research and analysis about other people with the same block-issue. It occur to me once in a while that even with all the struggles of my own, I was, still, close to the "best cases" compared to others having depression or bipolar-disorder. Firstly my parents accepted fact of disorder and the necessity of treatments. They *believe in science* in a way, probably since they're professors and all. Most of the persons on forums do not have such supporting and *constructive* parents to start with. Secondly, I myself was able to spend my mana on struggling the way out, and willing to take any risk. This gave me some edge but didn't let easy my tension even when I eat or sleep. No self-cutting or suicidal attempts in retrospect, but full-alert 24/7 with no single second of easiness as well. Guess coins have to sides.

If I were to make a conclusion about, ultimately, why I have to launch this project, I would only use a quote from Chaos Rings III, chapter 3:

> That day Geiser and I talked a lot. And he said that living required no credentials or qualifications, only the will to survive.

Solving problems requires no academic titles. Should I try to cope with something, I'm working on a *problem* like doing math, which requires the will to solve it, end of story.

## Why This?

I would answer this question from two perspectives.

First and foremost, conventional therapies, according to the experience of myself as well as many a person, are somewhat non-flexible and mechanical, in average cases; and can be misleading and risky in among-the-worst ones.

### Shortcomings of Conventional Treatments

Medical treatments, clinical/mental consultations as well as physical interventions, cannot solve mental problems respectively on their own.

Mental problems are nested, complicated and *multi-dimensional*. A good night of sleep and a piece of joke will not fix depression, as well as a tablet of medicine: Not just on its own at least. As I discovered in part of my literature review of this proj. , about which I'd like to elaborate later, curing mental "sicknesses" or "disorders" are different from recovering from a cold or a fever. Should you catch a cold, a *biological* therapy is more than enough, and proper nutritional and medical support would definitely fit the bill.

Say, if a doctor attempts to recover a non-human like a cat or a dog from a common cold, he follows the same principle, if not the exact same methods, as he does with humans. However, mental problems are not *only biological* and cannot be cured without a *psychological or cognitive* process, which is *human exclusive*. Outbreaks and distortions may still occur even if both "patient and doctor" make no mistake in applying pharmaceutical measures and meeting the *biological needs*. Love, understanding and sense of belonging are among some philosophical and abstract concepts that are not able to be replicated through electromagnetic apparatus and biochemical compounds: Not yet.

> I surrounded *patient and doctor* with quotation marks due to the notation being a *common bias* even for many an expert, as mentioned in Literature Review.

### Inaccessibility of Proper Treatments

This story can be told in two dimensions: *Inaccessible* and *Improper* treatments.

Inaccessibility is quite severe itself, on one hand due to *poverty* or medical-resource deficiency, which is among the *objective facts*, that many a scholar believed to be the sole reason of such inaccessibility of treatments. However, recent studies pretty much countered this idea, stating that many persons among the youth, born and raised *middle-class, if not richer households* in urban areas, are still vulnerable to such inaccessibility of treatments when facing mental crisis.

To resolve this contradiction, we believe there being more reasons behind *treatment inaccessibility* than poverty itself: A bias of *social awareness*, which is *subjective*. People are generally *unaware of the non-triviality and even the severity of mental problems*, stating that these *symptoms* are solely *overthinking or pretending*. There could be different ideas that vary from case to case, but all revolving about the same *thesis*, that ones suffering is *trivial* or *unreal*, because its *just in his mind*.

This is a common logical fallacy, as mentioned by *J.K.Rowling* in Harry Potter series in lines of *Albus Dumbledore*:

> Is this real, or its just happening inside my head? --- Of course its happening inside your head, Harry. But why would it mean that it is not real?

Torment and sorrow, in physical/chemical/biological or social/psychological/philosophical contexts, is ultimately the *same principle with different notations* as often referred to in mathematics/algorithms, and both are *real enough to be paid attention*.
